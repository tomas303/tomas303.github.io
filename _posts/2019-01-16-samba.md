Here is my basic knowledge I picked up trying to use samba shares for my needs. I use it for sharing files between my host system(linux) and various guest systems(linux, windows) in particular. I want to share folders in such a way I can use it as a guest or as a user specified by login. Guest access is fine as long as you don't need to change access rights. This is allowed for file owner or root only and since files created by guest are owned by nobody this is not possible(maybe it is achiavable, but in such a case little bit unusual). I prefer to use valid login on samba server and uid and gid parameter in mount command to refer to client user account I want to work with.



# Short version:

## Samba configuration file:
{% highlight bash %}
[global]
server role = standalone server
security = user
map to guest = Bad user

[shareone]
   comment = for testing sharing
   path = /share/one
   guest ok = yes
   browseable = yes
   read only = no
{% endhighlight %}

## Mount command on linux:
{% highlight bash %}
mount -t cifs //bunty.local/shareone -o user=joe,password=joe,gid=jim,uid=jim /mnt/buntyshareone/
{% endhighlight %}

## Mount command on windows:
{% highlight cmd %}
net use \\bunty.local\shareone
mklink /d c:\mnt\buntyshareone \\bunty.local\shareone
{% endhighlight %}

It is highly addictive to use similar mount system technique like is on linux, I have letter C only for quite a while:).



# Long version:

I had decided to use last version of ubuntu to test samba server so I downloaded last iso file(ubuntu-18.10-live-server-amd64.iso) and installed it as virtulbox guest. I installed zeroconf network and ssh server along with samba server. Zeroconf network takes care for translating names to IP addresses in my host only network and accessing server from my host console makes work with system a lot easier.

I am not prefixing commands with sudo in examples. So you need to prefix it when necessary or switch to root for a while using sudo interactive regime `sudo -i` or whatever.

{% highlight bash %}
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
apt-get install avahi-daemon libnss-mdns mdns-scan
apt-get install openssh-client openssh-server
apt-get install samba
{% endhighlight %}


Next I created directory to share and user to use to login to samba server. I want guest login to have full rights so that is whay I set full access for everybody. I still use guest access from my windows guest.

{% highlight bash %}
mkdir -p /share/one
chmod g+rwx,o+rwx /share/one/
useradd joe
passwd joe
{% endhighlight %}


Let's backup samba configuration file
{% highlight bash %}
cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.original
{% endhighlight %}


replace it with test configuration
{% highlight bash %}
echo "[global]
server role = standalone server
security = user
map to guest = Bad user

[shareone]
   comment = for testing sharing
   path = /share/one
   guest ok = yes
   browseable = yes
   read only = no

" > /etc/samba/smb.conf
{% endhighlight %}


restart samba service

{% highlight bash %}
service smbd restart
{% endhighlight %}


mount share on client linux system

{% highlight bash %}
mount -t cifs //bunty.local/shareone -o user=joe,password=joe /mnt/buntyshareone/
{% endhighlight %}


create new file

{% highlight bash %}
touch /mnt/buntyshareone/test1
{% endhighlight %}


and list shared directory on samba server
{% highlight bash %}
ls -l /share/one/
total 0
-rwxr--r-- 1 nobody nogroup 0 Jan 12 21:39 test1
{% endhighlight %}


File was created, but owner is nobody and group is nogroup. Since I didn't add user joe to samba users, samba server didn't recognized him and logged me as guest instead. This is what combination of `security = user` and `map to guest = Bad user` will do - when you use bad user for login, you will get logged as guest.


Let's add user joe(with password joe)
{% highlight bash %}
smbpasswd -a joe
{% endhighlight %}

remount share and create other new file and list shared directory once again
{% highlight bash %}
umount /mnt/buntyshareone/
mount -t cifs //bunty.local/shareone -o user=joe,password=joe /mnt/buntyshareone/
touch /mnt/buntyshareone/test2
ls -l /share/one/
total 0
-rwxr--r-- 1 nobody nogroup 0 Jan 12 21:39 test1
-rwxr--r-- 1 joe    joe     0 Jan 12 23:05 test2
{% endhighlight %}


You can see now I am logged in as user joe. Let's add user jim to client computer and use this account to work with share. I configured separately all parts of new account just to have here some memo in case I need this info in future. Many things can be done by useradd parameters or you can use more friendly adduser program.

{% highlight bash %}
useradd jim
passwd jim
usermod -s /bin/bash jim
mkdir -p /home/jim
cp -r /etc/skel/. /home/jim
chown -R jim:jim /home/jim
{% endhighlight %}


Log as jim on client computer and list shared directory

{% highlight bash %}
ls -l /mnt/buntyshareone/
total 0
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 0 Jan 12 22:39 test1
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 0 Jan 13 00:05 test2
{% endhighlight %}


You can see read and execute rights for user jim. I want to have full rights for jim, but don't want to be logged as root. So I employ attributes gid and uid for this very purpose

{% highlight bash %}
umount /mnt/buntyshareone/
mount -t cifs //bunty.local/shareone -o user=joe,password=joe,gid=jim,uid=jim /mnt/buntyshareone/
ls -l /mnt/buntyshareone/
total 0
-rwxr-xr-x 1 jim jim 0 Jan 12 22:39 test1
-rwxr-xr-x 1 jim jim 0 Jan 13 00:05 test2
{% endhighlight %}


And voila - jim is owner from client point of view. But remember - you cannot achive grater rights then the user used to login to samba server have. Other possibility here is to use noparm parameter in mount command. This will cause not to check permission on client side of share. I hadn't test it, I just belive explanation in man pages. I am satisfied with setup I described before.



# Tips:

* user information in passwd file
{% highlight bash %}
cat /etc/passwd | grep jim
jim:x:1001:1001::/home/jim:/bin/bash
{% endhighlight %}


* user information about ids and gids
{% highlight bash %}
id jim
uid=1001(jim) gid=1001(jim) groups=1001(jim)
{% endhighlight %}


* list samba server users
{% highlight bash %}
pdbedit -L -v

* View details about connected share
{% highlight bash %}
mount | grep bunty
//bunty.local/shareone on /mnt/buntyshareone type cifs (rw,relatime,vers=default,cache=strict,username=joe,uid=1001,forceuid,gid=1001,forcegid,addr=192.168.56.101,file_mode=0755,dir_mode=0755,soft,nounix,serverino,mapposix,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,echo_interval=60,actimeo=1,user=joe)
{% endhighlight %}


* Another command to display details about connected share
{% highlight bash %}
findmnt -t cifs | grep bunty
/mnt/buntyshareone //bunty.local/shareone      cifs   rw,relatime,vers=default,cache=strict,username=joe,uid=1001,forceuid,gid=1001,forcegid,addr=192.168.56.101,file_mode=0755,dir_mode=0755,soft,nounix,serverino,mapposix,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,echo_interval=60,actimeo=1
{% endhighlight %}


* Manual for mount cifs file system
{% highlight bash %}
man mount.cifs
{% endhighlight %}


* Unix extensions have an influence on sharing, but I didn't find any source of information about its possibilities. Especially in case of setup samba as standalone server. As of now unix extensions works only with protocol version 1.0 anyway. You can see it in output of `mount` a `findmnt` command as nounix flag. So all setup depend on how you configure samba in this case, shared folder and mount command(parameters like uid, forceuid, gid, forcegid, file_mode, dir_mode, noperm parameters). There are a lot more params described in samba man pages and smb.conf original file.


* Sometimes cifs mount in fstab failed due to network wasn't prepared yet. I had googled somewhere(don't know exact link location now), that this is a problem with systemd and can be solved by adding comment=systemd.automount. I had no problem from time I set it up.
{% highlight bash %}
mount -t cifs //bunty.local/shareone -o comment=systemd.automount,user=joe,password=joe,gid=jim,uid=jim /mnt/buntyshareone/
{% endhighlight %}
