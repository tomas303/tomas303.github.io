I collect here some pieces of usefull information about bash found elsewhere on internet.


### Colon at the beginning of line
I found colon explained [here][colon-at-the-beginning] - it means no-op command. Command itself is evaluated - or rather all expansions are proceeded, but command itself is not run.
It is commonly used to assign default values to variables. Braces here are part of parameter's expansion - that is to precede expression with $. And meaning of := I found [here][bash-parameter-expansion].<br>
```=``` just stands for reassigment<br>
```:``` modify it to behave equally in cases variable is not set and variable has empty value.

```bash
: ${VAR1:=hello}
echo $VAR1
VAR2=hi
: ${VAR2:=goodmorning}
echo $VAR2
```

```bash
hello
hi
```


### Use grep to find out match only
Grep command itself by default display all line where match occured. [Here][grep output only what matched] I learned about ```-o``` parameter what causes to output only what was matched.<br>
```-P``` is perl regular expression syntax

```bash
echo "ip adress is 1.2.3.4, really" | grep -o -P -e "(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}"
```

```bash
1.2.3.4
```


### Sent to stdin
I found some interesting things about stdin [here] [send string to stdin] and [here] [Here Strings]. So you can use ```<<<```, ```<(...)``` to redirect output of command - and there are no spaces after redirection and pipe ```|```.

```bash
cat <<< "This is coming from the stdin"
cat <(ls ~/test1) <(ls ~/test2)
echo hello | cat
```

```bash
This is coming from the stdin
filex_intest1
filey_intest2
hello
```

One difference(but don't know details) is you can fetch file directly to loop

```bash
while read line
do
	echo $line
done < ~/test1/filex_intest1
```
But when used whith pipe you need command to sent content of file

```bash
cat ~/test1/filex_intest1 | while read line
do
	echo $line
done
```

Output is same in both cases. Output contains lines ending with EOL. If last row do not end with EOL it won't be printed.
```bash
line one
line two
```

### Evaluate regular expression
Evaluate regular expression is one part of [evaluate expression]. Syntax of regular expressions here is [gnu basic regular expression] and that is why regular expression looks so akwardly. Many characters just need to be escaped. Expression is searched from begin(like beeing prepend with ```^```) and when matching group is used it will return match for this group. Only first group behaves like this.

```bash
expr 'ip adress is 1.2.3.4, really' : '.*\(\([0-9]\{1,3\}\.\)\{3\}[0-9]\{1,3\}\)'
```

```bash
1.2.3.4
```
