## How to make a color transparent in Gimp

Here [make a color transparent] I found super helpful tip to make one color transparent. As explained by using alpha channel it will influence all pixels and not only one color as wanted. It's basically about to select fuzzy selection tool(icon like magic wand), turn all parameters to zero and click on the area with selected color. Then by pressing Del or by Edit / Clear selected area will be cleared and becomes transparent.
