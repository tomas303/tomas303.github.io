Add remote upstream(or whatever) for forked repository:

~~~cmd
git remote add upstream https://github.com/somerepo.git
~~~

Change remote url(f.e. in my case to use url with access token):

~~~cmd
git remote set-url origin https://login:token@github.com/somerepo.git
~~~

Show default tracking info for local branches(git status shows it too
if configured ... your branch is up to date with ...):

~~~cmd
git branch -vv
~~~

Unset tracking info:

~~~cmd
git branch --unset-upstream
~~~

Set tracking info:

~~~cmd
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/somebranch
~~~

Show tracking info for remote branches:

~~~cmd
git remote show origin
~~~

Import branches from previously forked repo reffered as upstream into
curren repo reffered as origin:

~~~cmd
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b newbranch upstream/newbranch
git push -u origin newbranch
~~~
